 🎧 Headphones Web Page

Welcome to the Headphones Landing Page, a fully functional, responsive, and accessible web page built from scratch using only HTML and CSS.

> 🎨 Designed by Nicolas Philippot – UI/UX Designer
> 💻 Developed as part of the ALX Front-End Curriculum

 Project Objective
This project showcases my ability to:

* Translate a **Figma design** into clean, semantic HTML and CSS.
* Build a **pixel-perfect**, responsive layout **without using any CSS frameworks** like Bootstrap.
* Focus on **accessibility**, **user experience**, and **mobile responsiveness**.
* Use only **vanilla HTML/CSS** – no JavaScript.


🔧 Requirements Met

✅ No external CSS libraries (e.g., Bootstrap)
✅ No JavaScript
✅ Mobile responsiveness at `480px` or less
✅ Hover/active effects for links (`#FF6565`)
✅ Hover/active effects for buttons (opacity `0.9`)
✅ Max content width `1000px`, centered
✅ Fonts matched to design (`Source Sans Pro`, `Spin Cycle OT`)
✅ Semantic and accessible HTML structure

🧱 Built With

* **HTML5** – Semantic, accessible, and structured.
* **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, Transitions.
* **Figma** – Used to extract layout, spacing, fonts, and color details.

📱 Responsive Design

The layout adjusts smoothly for:

* 📺 **Desktop screens** – Structured with spacing, columns, and visuals.
* 📱 **Mobile view (≤ 480px)** – Stacked layout, adjusted paddings, and mobile-friendly buttons/navigation.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Developer Notes

* You can round float values if the Figma design gives decimal sizes (e.g., 13.78px → 14px).
* The layout is **centered** with a max width of `1000px` for readability and aesthetics.
* Colors, font weights, spacing, and paddings were carefully measured from the Figma file.
